                I began programming at age 9 in BASIC and assembly
                language. Since age 15, I have been a freelance software
                engineer for companies like Electronic Arts, L'Oreal, Group
                SEB/Moulinex, the Paris Airports, and France Electricity, and
                have been an open source contributor

                   target="_blank">Kraken API documentation</a>.

                I studied Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College in the US,
                followed by an MBA at INSEAD in France. I also have 2 years of
                marketing brand management experience in consumer products at
                L'Oreal and speak English, French, and German.
              </p>
              <p>
                In March 2019, I began learning to contribute to Bitcoin Core. I
                started by studying the repository and the social process and
                specific technical details of contributing to the project. I've
                been compiling and curating this knowledge at
                <a href="https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development"
                   target="_=
                   blank">https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development</a>,
                   which is frequently recommended to other developers like in
                   this
                <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1177251272560394240"

                   target="_blank">September 2019 article</a> and is becoming an
                   educational resource.
              </p>
              <p>
                It became clear that what is most needed and useful, and
                paradoxically the least done by new Bitcoin Core contributors,
                is review and testing of PRs and issues. Roughly 300 pull
                requests and 700 issues are open at any given moment in Bitcoin
                Core waiting for experienced review and testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I rapidly became one of the most active new contributors and
                reviewers on Bitcoin Core, as well as on

                In early June, Adam Jonas and John Newbery invited me to attend
                the Chaincode Labs residency seminars. I spent 2 weeks in the
                Chaincode Labs Manhattan office learning about Bitcoin and
                meeting core developers and the summer residents. Since then, I
                have been contributing part-time in the evenings and
                weekends. Bitcoin Core maintainers and developers frequently ask
                me for review, testing or a fix as if I were full-time on
                Bitcoin Core.

                Opening pull requests has not been a priority of mine. Yet, by
                reviewing and understanding what needs to be done and how to
                make contributions easy to review, I have had
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits=?author=jonatack"
                   target="_blank">33 commits merged into Bitcoin Core</a>

                -- more than any other new contributor this year to Bitcoin
                Core. I am currently

                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors"
                   target="_blank">#40 of the Bitcoin Core all-time
                   contributors</a>

                and in the top 10-15 among the currently active
                contributors. Every Bitcoin Core commit I have made has been
                merged -- a merge rate of 100%. This shows effectiveness in
                having improvements merged.

                While reviewing, I found and fixed several Bitcoin Core bugs and
                regressions. Here's the most recent example (I can pick on John
                since he is incredibly well-respected and a great guy): The

                I regularly attend the weekly Bitcoin Core IRC meetings and

            <p>
              I plan to prioritise my time to Bitcoin roughly as follows:
            </p>
            <h3>
              Robustness > Privacy > Features > Scaling > UI
            </h3>
            <p>
              Thus <b>robustness, censorship resistance, and privacy</b> are my
              highest priorities.

                      Increasing Bitcoin Core's <b>robustness</b>: finding and
                      fixing regressions and bugs, and adding missing test
                      coverage and better testing in under-utilised areas like
                      the P2P network, fuzzing, and

                      The number one bottleneck in Bitcoin Core
                      is <b>experienced review</b> of difficult PRs. I would
                      dedicate more time to <b>deep review</b> of the important
                      PRs that often sit for months without enough review to be
                      merged and have to go through multiple painful rebases,
                      which blocks vital progress and demotivates experienced
                      long-term contributors from working on Bitcoin Core.

                            I would unblock these critical PRs by reviewing them
                            and by <b>coordinating</b> with the maintainers and
                            other contributors to ensure timely review where it
                            is most needed and difficult.

                            Reviewing also means continuing to find and fix
                            regressions and bugs throughout Bitcoin Core and
                            making it more <b>robust</b>.
