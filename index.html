                I began programming at age 9 in BASIC and assembly
                language. From age 14 to 18, I wrote several professional
                games in assembly for Atari and Commodore computers that were
                internationally published and widely known.
              </p>
              <p>
                I studied Computer Science at
                <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd
                  College</a> in Claremont, California (USA), Business
                  Administration and French
                  at <a href="https://oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">Oregon
                  State University</a>, followed by an MBA
                  at <a href="https://www.insead.edu/"
                  target="_blank">INSEAD</a> in Fontainebleau, France. In
                  addition to software engineering, I have 2 years of marketing
                  brand management experience in mass consumer products at
                  L'Oréal from their world headquarters in Paris. I speak
                  English, French, and German.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past decade I have been a freelance software engineer
                for large companies and an open source contributor
                (<a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/"
                target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Top 100</a>) and library

              <p>
                In March 2019, I started learning to contribute to Bitcoin Core,
                beginning with studying the repository and the social process
                and technical details of contributing to the project. I've been
                compiling and curating this knowledge at
                <a href="https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development"
                   target="_blank">https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development</a>,
                   which is frequently recommended to other developers like in
                   this
                <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1177251272560394240"

                   target="_blank">September 2019 article</a> and is becoming an
                   educational resource.
              </p>
              <p>
                It became clear that what is most needed and useful, and
                paradoxically the least done by new contributors, is
                <a href="/articles/on-reviewing-and-helping-those-who-do-it"
                   target="_blank">review and testing of PRs and issues</a>.
                More than
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls"
                target="_blank">350 pull requests</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues"
                target="_blank">750 issues</a> are open at any given moment in
                Bitcoin Core waiting for experienced review and testing, and the
                amount continues to increase. The maintainers need help!

                In early June 2019, thanks to John Newbery and Adam Jonas, I was

                the Chaincode Labs office in Manhattan learning about Bitcoin

                Opening pull requests has not been a priority of mine. Yet, as a
                by-product of reviewing, finding issues, seeing what needs to be
                done, and understanding how to make contributions easy to
                review, I have had

                While reviewing Bitcoin Core pull requests, I have caught a fair
                number of bugs before they were merged and found and fixed a
                few regressions afterwards as well.

              <p>
                I plan to prioritise my time to Bitcoin roughly as follows:
              </p>
              <h3 id="priorities">Robustness > Privacy > Features > Scaling > UI</h3>
              <p>
                Robustness and privacy/censorship resistance are therefore my
                highest priorities.
              </p>
              <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Dedicating time to <b>review</b> of the important, critical PRs
                  that often sit for months without enough review to be merged
                  and have to go through multiple painful rebases, which blocks
                  vital progress and demotivates experienced long-term
                  contributors from working on Bitcoin Core.
                  <p>
                    The number one bottleneck in Bitcoin Core is experienced
                    review of difficult PRs. As
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/moneyball" target="_blank">Steve Lee</a>
                    of
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/sqcrypto" target="_blank">Square Crypto</a>
                    once wrote to me: "If literally all a developer did was
                    review hard but important PRs it'd be incredibly valuable."
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The idea is to unblock these critical PRs not only by
                        reviewing them, but also coordinating with the
                        maintainers and other contributors to ensure timely
                        review where it is most needed and difficult.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Reviewing also means continuing to find and fix
                        regressions and bugs throughout Bitcoin Core to make it
                        more <b>robust</b>.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increasing Bitcoin Core's <b>robustness</b>: finding and
                  fixing regressions and bugs, and adding missing test coverage
                  and better testing. Robustness can also mean working on
                  codebase performance, modularity and multiprocess.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improving the Bitcoin Core wallet features and RPC/CLI
                  interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strengthening Bitcoin Core's <b>decentralization</b>,
                  <b>censorship resistance</b> and <b>privacy</b> by working on
                  the <b>peer-to-peer network privacy</b> and resistance to
                  surveillance and attacks: researching and proposing
                  improvements, and collaborating with and testing work by
                  fellow developers and researchers.
                </li>
