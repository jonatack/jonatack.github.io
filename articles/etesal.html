Jon, could I have a one long message with all the info that I could forward 🙏

Like one long one with everything in context and everything that you want and
maybe also a description of the citadel 🙏

And how is affected by the power lines.

Etesal wants to build 3 high voltage power transmission towers right next to the
land and destroy the natural environment of the hill.

The 3 towers would be only 90, 150 and 250 meters away from the house, and one
is only 50 meters from the NE line of the land. The lines would cross along the
entire view from the top of the hill on the upper left down to the new Tamanique
substation on thelower right

It was planned to be an elite place for visiting world class Bitcoin Core
researchers and developers to come work in nature. And for me to work too. Not
for profit or rental.

Etesal could have chosen one of the neighboring hills to bring power lines from
Talnique to Tamanique

They chose a hill with a dozen houses already on it. People live there using
solar power.

> Well, if there is a reasonable alternative I believe we can always find a way

That would be amazing

> Just know that progress and cheaper acces to electricity for the many will
always be priority

Of course. But they do not have to use this particular hill when there are other
options

The first tower built next to the future Tamanique substation

I purchased the whole hill cove in order to try to protect it from development
🥲

I’ve invested $700k so far

Promiso, the closing of the sale is planned next month

If we close, then yes I would own the land. Etesal paid very small amounts to
neighboring owners for the right to use their land. As low as $5k paid.

Just an update that there is another hill very close nearby with no
people and houses living on it that Etesal could use instead. The other hill is
much less forested and beautiful. It appears to have once been used for growing
corn.

The last two days their subcontractors have repeatedly begun using heavy
explosives that shake the Cerro Gloria 100 meters from where the Bitcoin Dev
House is nearly finished. They are doing it because there are rocks underground
that are causing them problems.

They are also causing environmental damage, a lot of heavy truck and motorcycle
traffic, and littering/trash to the area.

It is very sad to witness this beautiful natural site being turned into an
industrial area.

Sunset yesterday there. This will be covered all the way across with
high-voltage power towers and lines if the current route continues.

The hill a few hundred meters next to it to the East behind the tree line in
this photo could be used instead.

⁨⁨If helpful, I learned from talking with Hugo, the architect of the Etesal
towers, that this nearby uninhabited hill a few hundred meters to the East, the
option I mentioned above, was the original planned location. This is the view
yesterday from the third tower base on Cerro Gloria, next to the Bitcoin dev
house. What happened is that Etesal intimidated 3 of the rural owners of land
next to mine into signing away the rights for nearly nothing, under the threat
that if they refused, their land would be expropriated from them instead. Etesal
tried the same tactic with the seller of my land, who refused. If they had
cooperated, the towers would have been even closer to the town (Tamanique). So
Etesal took the shortcut of using the inhabited Cerro Gloria, next to Tamanique
and  nearer to the future power substation south of the town, to save costs. I
don’t know who pocketed the cost savings or if there are dirty hands. The
architect was surprised when the towers were moved to Cerro Gloria but no
reasons were given for the change. The Cerro Gloria community and I are trying
to learn more.⁩

> Well, does it look like from the bussines stand point would make sense to do
it in that one onstead to the previous planned one? I mean, as is such a
diferent part of the gov, if I complain I have to actually make a case to
complain, it eould have to be a legit concert towards the main pourpuse of the
energy proyect, which I know is priority as many people need the conectivity to
the grid.

Word of mouth locally is that there is a lot of corruption in the project.

The marketing has been that this government was fighting corruption.

- Workers and architects not being paid (am hearing from multiple sources).

- Changing the route in a bad way (they tried even closer to town but the
landowners refused).


- Intimidating 3 landowners next to me and threatening to take their land if
they didn’t give away the rights for very little.

The foreign investors in the neighboring houses (most of whom are returning
Salvadorenos) plan to make a lot of noise and negative publicity if the project
stays here. Corruption. That this is what happens to investors in SV. And of
course the elite Bitcoin core developer community will know and cannot come work
at this site as planned. I’ll have to cancel the project and seek redress from
the tribunals.

The loss to El Salvador’s image will be much higher than the maybe $50k they
saved by moving the towers to this hill. It’s dumb and bad business for
everyone.

Would be a win for the country to be able to have an elite developer hub here, a
quiet place in nature for world-class bitcoin R&D, which I was working and
investing a lot of money into this country and local economy to build. The only
one in all of Latin America.
