<p>
WHY -- the need to decentralize
</p>
<p>
- Dissatisfaction, widely seen in private, with
the process of at least two of the last three maintainership selection decisions.
</p>
<p>
- These decisions appear to be made only by the current maintainers, either in a
pre-decision after a grooming period before presenting the selection to the
contributors in the weekly IRC meeting, or by rejection six months after a
contributor nominated himself with initial approval by a large rough consensus
of contributors, including most of the maintainers at the time.
</p>
<p>
Also, critical information was not disclosed during one of the selection
  processes.
</p>
<p>
- This inbred quality has resulted in a current crop of maintainers that is much
less diverse in age and culture/social graph than before. Bitcoin Core
maintainers are now all young and are from or reside/have resided in the US and
UK.  The GUI maintainer currently in London is older but does not merge in the
main node repository.
</p>
<p>
- Maintainer mandates are for an open-ended time period, resulting in long
reigns until they either burn out and finally step down (Wladimir van der Laan,
Pieter Wuille, Jonas Schnelli, Samuel Dobson, and now Marco Falke), or are asked
to leave (Gavin Andresen).  This makes selecting and removing a maintainer, and
their status in the eyes of the outside world, a much bigger deal than it should
be.
</p>
<p>
- Previously, the maintainers represented a diversity of ages and were spread
out across the world, being from and living in Holland, Switzerland, Germany,
the US, Australia, and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
- Three of the six (update, now only four) maintainers are now concentrated in
one office in London and funded by the same organisation: Brink.  This not only
indicates centralization of location and funding, but is also well-known and
displayed on the Brink website.
</p>
<p>
- Maintainer centralization is also seen by the increasing number of self-merges
done by maintainers, starting in Fall 2021.
</p>
<p>
- Attack vector of narrative of Bitcoin Core power centralization underscores
the need to further decentralize where possible:
</p>
<p>
  - UK judges' February 2023 ruling to allow CSW appeal to move forward to
establish jurisprudence
</p>
<p>
  - 21 February 2023 Wall Street Journal article and tweets about
shadowy power control by six Core maintainers
</p>
<p>
  - Academics like Angela Walch harping on power centralization in Bitcoin Core
</p>
<p>
- Many long-term participants in the Bitcoin space are worried about this.
</p>
<p>
Best to improve decentralization proactively, rather than waiting to be forced
by legal jurisprudence, government regulation or hostile narratives.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
WHAT -- ideas to decentralize
</p>
<p>
- regularly and frequently rotate maintainers for a selfless tour of duty
focused on review and merges, evenhanded, janitorial as opposed to gatekeeping,
for 3-6 months — no more commit bits for life until revoked
</p>
<p>
- the tour of duty should minimize writing code / adding commits, to solve the
issue of self-merging and conflict of interest
</p>
<p>
- these steps should de-dramatize the selection process; the people doing them
should be chosen via an open, transparent, simple and fair process
</p>
<p>
- don’t require developers to congregate in a fixed geographic location (like
currently at Brink and Chaincode Labs)
</p>
<p>
- hold CoreDev developer meetups in non-Western locations and be much more
secret about them (as opposed to tweeting and talking about them to journalists)
</p>
<p>
- don’t discriminate or judge based on criteria related to identity or social graph
</p>
<p>
- promote kindness and empathy

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
HOW to decentralize
</p>
<p>
I've been seeking to be more detached, selfless and stoic about the project for my involvement to be sustainable for the long term.
</p>
<p>
- What do you hope will happen in Bitcoin Core in 2023? Try to rank your priorities.
</p>
<p>
I suppose more focus on finding and reducing bugs, with even-handed review, reactions, and merging.  Fairness, wisdom, kind behavior, less arbitrariness and favoritism.
</p>
<p>
- Is there anything you'd change about the process/project that would help those things happen?
</p>
<p>
I've been thinking for some time about how we can decentralize the project more (power, geo-location, funding, maintainership, release management, repo ownership), increase the bus factor, and avoid maintainer/contributor burn-out.
</p>
<p>
One aspect I'll touch on briefly here is that of less power centralization around maintainer behavior and the decision-making of the selection process.
</p>
<p>
Among other ideas, perhaps maintainership and release process management should both be a regularly rotated tour of duty.  A janitorial, time-limited mission -- maybe three to six months of selfless dedication -- involving just review and merging, with little to no commits or self-merges.
</p>
<p>
Frequent regular rotation and transaparency would de-dramatize the selection process, which should be clear, rapid and by rough consensus of regular contributors and not of an inner circle.  Making the maintainer role less glamorous and rare would help reduce the ego and power involved and avoid people doing it until they burn out.
</p>
<p>
There are good reasons to consider decentralizing the project further like this where possible, like upcoming legal jurisprudence (the CSW appeal ruling), attack vectors via politico-media narratives (like the recent WSJ feature+tweets about Bitcoin centralization in the hands of six developers), the market share dominance of Bitcoin Core, the negative community view of "core devs", improving contributor happiness, and sustainability / burn-out avoidance.
</p>
<p>
It may possibly be a question of whether we take steps proactively or are forced to by circumstances, in order for Bitcoin to remain sustainable and resist attempts to centralize or subvert it as it grows.
</p>
<p>
(An aspect of decentralization that I do not find as helpful is that of splitting parts of the codebase out to separate repositories.  We ought to continue to modularize the codebase and separate the consensus code, while decentralizing the project management and processes.  But not necessarily fragment Bitcoin Core -- and its few contributors -- out to many repositories each with even fewer contributors as was done with the GUI.)
</p>
<p>
This is incomplete and written quickly, but I'm writing an article and will be seeking input/feedback.
</p>
<p>
- What one thing would make you happier or more productive?
</p>
<p>
More fairness, kindness, wisdom and tolerance in general.  Less ego and
favoritism. With Wladimir's departure, things have been more difficult, and I
expect worse after Marco's departure.  The two selection processes we saw for
maintainers last year were imperfect, ultimately opaque and profoundly
dissatisfying, highlighting power centralization and problematic or contradictory
criteria applied.
</p>
<p>
Maintainers in our current long-term, dynastic roles really should primarily be reviewers, with a great deal of life and software experience, ideally kind, wise, selfless, service-oriented and humble, and diverse in social graph, funding, age, and location.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, all I can do is suggest improvements and carry on, hopefully humbly
and with kindness.  Bitcoin tends to kill heroes (and hubris).  The project will
always need more reviewing and testing, bug-finding and bug-fixing, and
encouraging new contributors, and those evergreen aspects will continue to be a
focus for me.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, journalists tend to be enamored of over-focusing on maintainers and portraying power centralization.

It’s more dramatic and simplifies the story, but I have reservations regarding whether it’s good for bitcoin.


More so given the current context of legal attacks against bitcoin core developers involving the question of decentralization of power.

IMO the most important work happens during the review process. It’s relatively rare for a merge decision to go against that review in an impactful way and when it does, it’s usually called out.
</p>
<p>
The maintainers could all burn out and retire tomorrow, and it might be a temporary slowdown for the project, but project maintenance and development would continue. There are enough experienced long-term developers for that, if needed. We do need to continue increasing the bus factor, and it takes time to do that.

It’s probably inevitable that project power become more decentralized in any area where it can be in order for bitcoin to grow and thrive.  We arguably don’t have a choice in the face of legal and social/political attack vectors.

It’s possibly a question of whether we’re proactive about decentralizing further or wait until forced by events to do it.

But it seems likely to be needed given how journalists, academics and judges — among many others — are attracted by perceived power, status, money, centralization and sensationalism.
</p>
<p>
The maintainer role in this project isn’t (or at least shouldn't be) as powerful
as people (journalists, media, academics, maybe judges) like to think. The role
is supposed to be janitorial, e.g. merge things when there is enough review, and
try for a good order of merges when changes touch the same code. There’s little
quarterbacking or organizing (apart from a group chat channel between them,
from what I have heard).
</p>
<p>
It would be healthy to de-dramatize it to a rotating tour of duty, almost like jury duty…3-6 selfless months dedicated to reviewing and merging, and opening an issue when you see something you’d like to fix but not coding it or self-merging your own stuff during that time.
</p>
<p>
Maintainer selection shouldn’t be this big deal for life until you burn out. A regular rotation among the longer term contributors would fix that.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a transparent selection via a random draw of willing long-termers, based
on block hash or an automated draw or quick rough consensus among all contributors.
</p>
<p>
Do your 3 months, then back to regular contributing for a year or so.
This avoids burn-out and targeting and improves decentralization.
</p>
<p>
The selection should be transparent, quick and easy, with lower stakes, not a drawn-out
process like the seven months that Vasil’s maintainer proposal PR was open
before being rebuked by two people who decide.
</p>
<p>
That would open up the closed club and dynastic role that fascinates outsiders and make it less vulnerable to dev centralization narratives like in the WSJ article and tweets, or the CSW appeal ruling.
</p>
<p>
It is possible we're going to have to decentralize anyway whether we do it
proactively or not for bitcoin to survive as it grows
</p>
<p>
We should also rotate the release management. Every release a different release manager.
</p>
<p>
These steps would also reduce the attraction of the role with respect to ambitious people drawn to it for power... a good thing.
</p>
<p>
Matt Odell question: Has anyone proposed scheduled rotations like this in the
past?
</p>
<p>
I am not aware of any.
