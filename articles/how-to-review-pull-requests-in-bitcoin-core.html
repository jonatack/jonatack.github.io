                September 4, 2019 at 13:52
              </p>
              <p>
                Reviewing and testing can be the best ways to begin contributing
                to Bitcoin Core.
              </p>
              <p>
                Experienced review and testing are regularly cited by long-term
                Bitcoin Core developers as both
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  resource bottlenecks, and
                </li>
                <li>
                  the best and most helpful way to begin contributing and
                    earning reputation in the community.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Yet the process and learning curve can seem intimidating and in
                practice very few new contributors do it.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a newcomer, this article represents my understanding after a
                few months, a couple hundred PRs reviewed, a few issues tested
                or handled, and a few dozen commits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of this understanding was gained from
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  contributing to a large open source project,
                  <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Ruby on Rails</a>,
                  and co-editing its blog and newsletter,

                  daily discussions on this topic of mutual interest with my
                  good friend and colleague,
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/kaspth"
                     rel="nofollow">Kasper Timm Hansen</a>,

                  and since 2016 a member of the

              </ul>
              <p>
                Yet much of it is unique to Bitcoin Core and came only with
                time. I would have preferred to know these things from the
                start.

                <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests">PR</a>:
                An acronym for <em>pull request</em>, sometimes called a merge
                request. A proposed change to the code or documentation in the
                source code repository.

              <h3 id="general">GENERAL</h3>

              <p>
                As a newcomer, the goal is to try to add value, with
                friendliness and humility, while learning as much as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good approach is to make it not about you, but rather "How can
                I best serve?"
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most challenging aspects facing new contributors is
                the breadth of the codebase and the complexities of the
                technologies surrounding it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be aware of what you don’t know; long-term contributors have
                years of experience and context. The community has built up a deep
                collective wealth of knowledge and experience. Keep in mind that
                your new ideas may have already been proposed or considered
                several times in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that contributor and maintainer resources are limited —
                ask for them carefully and respectfully. The goal is to try to
                give more than you take, to help more than hinder, while getting
                up to speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Try to figure things out on your own, at least sufficiently to
                respect others' time.

                  Newbery</a>.
                You'll benefit the most if you prepare for each meeting in
                advance by studying, building, and testing the PR under review —
                and then actually reviewing it! Go through the notes, questions,
                and logs of the previous meetings; there is gold in there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many newcomers begin by opening pull requests that add to the
                hundreds already awaiting valuable review. In many cases, it may
                be better to begin by reviewing the existing pull requests and
                starting to understand what kind of pull requests and review are
                most helpful, while slowly gaining the big picture.
              </p>

              <h4 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h4>

              <p>
                The big picture is more important than nits, spelling, or code
                style.
              </p>

              <p>
                Steps to improve understanding of the big picture:

                Aim for quality over quantity and a balance between deep work
                and quick wins.

              <p>
                Documentation is important, e.g. high-level documentation of how

              <h4 id="nits">Nits</h4>

              <p>
                Try to avoid overly commenting in PRs about nits, minutiae and
                code style, particularly with PRs labeled as WIP, or when a PR
                has just been filed and the PR author is mainly looking for
                Concept ACKs and Approach ACKs, e.g. general consensus, not
                nitpicking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long-term contributors report that activity like this repels
                them, and it can diminish your social capital on the
                project. Try to understand what kind of review is needed and
                when to do what.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best time for any nit comments is after the Concept/Approach
                ACKs and consensus on the PR, and before the PR is finalised and
                has tested ACKs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Give nits and style advice in a friendly, light, enabling way —
                as in, feel free to ignore, feel free to adjust if you happen to
                rebase, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep in mind that no one is forced to take your review comments
                into account; it's perfectly fine for the author to reply that
                they don't want to do something if they feel it is outside the
                scope of the change, especially if your comment is nitpicky.
              </p>

              <h4 id="scale-up">Scale up</h4>

              <p>
                When you can, scale up the difficulty and priority of the PRs
                you review.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can add more value and learn more by taking the time to do
                deep, quality review of the
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/8">high-priority
                  PRs</a>
                and the more difficult PRs. These PRs tend to intimidate
                people and can stagnate for months, killing their author's
                motivation with death by a thousand cuts from lack of quality
                review, nitpicking/code style bikeshedding, and rebase hell.
                Reviewing them well provides a true service to Bitcoin.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process of ramping up takes time; nothing can substitute for
                months and years invested in gathering context and understanding

                Keep ego and hopes out of the process. Don't take things
                personally and keep moving forward.

                <em>Don't trust, verify.</em> Minimise dependance on GitHub in
                your review process. Use the GitHub website only for the GitHub
                metadata, e.g. reading comments and adding your own comments —
                not for reviewing the commits and code, which you should do in

                Therefore, a review begins by pulling the PR branch down to your
                computer to build and review locally. There are different ways
                to do it depending on what you want, your needs, disk space,

                You can test a PR either on the contributor's branch or with the
                changes merged on top of master. Testing the latter can be
                useful to see if anything merged into master since the last PR
                commit breaks the changes.

                Next, launch the build and tests while you begin reading the
                code locally. You'll need to become comfortable with

                Become adept at searching the repository with
                <code>git grep</code>. You'll use it constantly to find stuff
                in the codebase. Run
                <code>git grep --help</code> on the command line for help or
                information.
              </p>

              <h4 id="if-youre-not-sure-where-to-start">If you're not sure where to start</h4>
              <p>
                Read the code, read the PR comments, then re-read both. Find
                something that doesn't make sense and try to figure it
                out. Repeat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once it all starts to make sense, run bitcoind on testnet (or on
                mainnet with very small amounts), and tail or search through the
                relevant logs (run
                <code>bitcoin-cli help logging</code> for the various bitcoind
                logging categories and how to toggle them on/off).
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe add some custom logging, LogPrintfs, or asserts; it's
                always a privilege to add these into other people's code (to see
                how, run <code>git grep -ni logprintf</code> or <code>git grep
                  assert</code> in the repository).
              </p>
              <p>
                Run the relevant functional tests and look through the debug
                logs. Verify that they fail in the expected way on master. Back
                in the PR branch, inverse or change the new tests to make them
                break and understand why.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe add C++
                <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/"
                target="_blank">gdb</a>
                or Python
                <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html"
                   target="_blank">pdb</a>
                breakpoints. Examine values. Run RPC commands.
              </p>
              <p>
                Check if any call sites, headers or declarations have been
                overlooked in the PR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Try refactoring the code to be better or prettier, and discover
                why that doesn't work. Expect it to take twice as long as you
                planned it to. Yes, it's work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe run strace (<code>man page strace</code>) to trace system
                calls and signals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the changes, contributing benchmarks, memory
                profiling/valgrind or flame graphs to a PR review can sometimes
                be very useful, and even decisive.

              <p>
                While you're reviewing, writing tests yourself can help you
                understand the behaviour and verify the changes, and if they add
                useful coverage you can propose them to the author for inclusion
                in the PR. Proposing automated tests is a really helpful way to
                start contributing. Authors appreciate it when someone reviews
                their PR and provides additional tests.

              <h4 id="big-picture-more-important-than-nits">Big picture &gt; nits</h4>
              <p>
                Remember, the big picture is much more important than nits,
                spelling, or code style. Re-read the
                <a href="#nits" target="_self">Nits</a>
                section above. Try to avoid commenting on these while reviewing,
                even if you have no other comments to make. I know, it's hard —
                I've done it too many times — but there's a better alternative:
              </p>

              <h4 id="ask-questions">Ask questions</h4>
              <p>
                A good thing you can do as a reviewer without specialised
                knowledge of the code is <em>ask questions</em>. A PR author is
                usually happy to discuss their work or see interest in it. So,
                spend 20 minutes or so looking at a change, find the thing that
                seems most confusing or surprising, and ask about it politely in
                the PR comments or on the
                <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-core-dev"
                   rel="nofollow">#bitcoin-core-dev</a>
                IRC channel. Chances are other people wonder about the same
                thing and it could be clarified or documented better. In this
                way you can learn and help make the project more accessible,
                too. (Credit for this paragraph:

                Be sure to learn and understand the Bitcoin Core

                  review process</a>.
                The process is
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15626">often</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16149">updated</a>,
                so refer back to it frequently.

                Concept ACK means the reviewer acknowledges and agrees with the
                goal of the change, but is not (yet) confirming they've looked
                at the code or tested it.  This can be a valuable signal to a PR
                author to let them know that the PR has merit and is headed in
                the right direction. As a corollary, a Concept NACK would
                indicate disagreement with the goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Approach ACK is a step further than Concept ACK and means
                agreement with both the goal and the approach used in
                implementing the change. Approach NACK would therefore indicate
                agreement with the goal but not the approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                Manual testing of new features and reported issues is always
                welcome. A comment that is really helpful in review: "Here's
                what I tested and my methodology", particularly to back up an
                ACK.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some PRs can be difficult to test or ACK due to complexity,
                context, or possibly a lack of tests or simulation
                framework. That shouldn't discourage you from reviewing. For
                example, if you've reviewed the code thoroughly, a comment like
                "the code looks correct to me, but I don't feel confident enough
                about behaviour to give an ACK" is a perfectly helpful
                contribution.
              </p>
              <p>
                When giving an ACK, specify the commits reviewed by appending
                the commit hash of the <code>HEAD</code> commit. The trustless
                way to do this is to use the hash from your <em>local</em>
                checkout of the branch and not from the GitHub web page. That
                way, unless your local tools are compromised, you ensure you are
                ACKing the exact changes. This is also useful when a force push
                happens and links to old commits are lost on GitHub.
              </p>
              <p>
                A full ACK could look like: "ACK <code>fa2f991</code>, I built,
                ran tests, tested manually by doing X/Y/Z and reviewed the code
                and it looks OK, I agree it can be merged."
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bitcoin Core merge script currently copies into the merge
                commit all ACK comments pertaining to the <code>HEAD</code>
                commit at the time of merge. Keep in mind that anything you
                write in an ACK comment that is copied by the merge script will
                be in git history forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                A complex PR usually requires at least 3-4 experienced ACKs
                before merging.

              <p>
                When you disagree, state your point of view once and move
                on. Don't flood the comments section, browbeat others or
                overreact. Remember that the most important thing is probably
                not the issue being discussed, but your relationship with the
                other contributors.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a new contributor, be cautious with giving a NACK. Assume by
                default that you might lack understanding or context. If you do
                NACK, provide good reasoning.

              <p>
                Some Bitcoin Core contributors sign and OpenTimestamp their
                ACKs. While that is beyond the scope of this document, it is
                surprisingly trivial to sign your commits using the
                <a href="https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-client/blob/master/doc/git-integration.md"

                After a while you'll notice that contributors sometimes review

                Over the years I had become disillusioned by the central
                influence of BDFLs in programming languages and open source
                projects. Wladimir van der Laan's
